- Static configuration
- Improvements to minion viewports (softer angle transitions to new destinations)
- Proxy option for using locally stored proxies, and proxy services
- Static captcha queue for manual solving (also disabling creation of the captcha queue when in automatic mode)
- Drastic changes towards the CapMonster solver module as it can cause problems and isn't efficent
- Proxy manager (current configuration is not efficent)
- Probably more afaik, just braindead because there's not much to Vanis.io
